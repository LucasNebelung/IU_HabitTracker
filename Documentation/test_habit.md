# habit_test.py Documentation

## Overview

The `habit_test.py` module contains unit tests for the `Habit` class and supporting functions in the Habit Tracker application. These tests ensure that the functionality of the program behaves as expected, covering aspects such as database initialization, habit management, and analytics.

### Unit Test Structure

The unit tests are organized into separate test methods within the `TestHabit` class. Each method focuses on testing specific aspects of the `Habit` class or related functions. The structure of the unit tests is as follows:

1. **Setup**: Preparing the test environment by defining datetime objects and creating instances of habits to simulate different scenarios.
2. **Database Module Tests**: Testing the initialization and functions of the database module, including database existence, table creation, insertion, updating, and deletion.
3. **Habit Class Tests**: Testing the methods and behaviors of the `Habit` class, such as controlling habit timing, checking off habits, and resetting habits.
4. **Analytics Module Tests**: Testing the functions in the analytics module, which provide insights into habit streaks and statistics.
5. **Tear Down**: Removing unwanted habits from the database after testing is complete to maintain a clean test environment.

### Test Cases

The unit tests cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability of the Habit Tracker application. Each test case is designed to validate specific functionality or behavior, including handling daily and weekly habits, managing habit streaks, and analyzing habit statistics.
