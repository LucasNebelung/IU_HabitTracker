# IU_HabitTracker

## Installation 

To run the application, simply download the files and execute the 'main.exe' file located in the 'dist' folder. For a demo version with test data, run the 'main_demo_with_testdata.exe' file. If you need to reset the database, just delete the 'habit_tracker.db' file, and the database will reset upon the next program launch. Rest assured, both .exe files will automatically reinitialize the database.

Alternatively, follow these steps:
1. Download the files.
2. Open them in your preferred IDE (e.g., VSCode).
3. Execute the 'main.py' file.
